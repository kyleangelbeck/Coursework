        Belinda ate a booger,
        on our field trip to Kentucky,
        I can't believe she did that,
        It's just so very yucky.
        I think it's really nasty,
        I'd die if they all knew,
        one time in the first grade,
        I ate a booger too.

        Belinda cut the big cheese on the bus from Minnesota
        and we were forced to breathe it all the way to South Dakota.
        This silent deadly stink bomb took its toll on all of us.
        Soon, twenty kids we're puking out the windows of the bus.
        That rotten egg just lingered the whole way to Mount Rushmore.
        Belinda cut a big slice of a cheese like none before.

        if you think that booger was gross,
        be glad you missed the county fair!
        belinda puked on all the rides
        and her slime got in my hair!

        while twirling on the loop-d-loop,
        i looked up toward the sky,
        i saw belinda high above
        and her barf fell in my eye!

        belinda started blowing chunks
        all over my little sister,
        she spewed some on the tilt-a whirl,
        she spewed some on the twister!

        we saw a most unsightly green,
        as belinda rode 'the comet'
        while she hovered, we got covered,
        in icky-sticky pickle vomit!

        "JHVTL IIVXS U" is repeated four times
            75, 140, 105
        "A EVEMZ FVITL" is repeated twice
            245
        The only common factor of these three strings is 5
        Thus, I predict that the length of the key is 5

        After playing around with different combinations,
        I tried BRDTS and found that the word eat shows up multiple
        times in the string "JHVTL IIVXS U" "XSU".
        So, Assuming that the first letter and last two letters are correct,
        I discovered more three letter words that work, "you", "bug", "rat"

        Using this, and the assumption that the keyword is not nonsense,
        and is actually a word, I found that the word "BEETS" could be made
        using these IOC values. This resulted in the following decrypted text...

            I'd rather eat soap scuum and witch's toenails.
            I'd rather eat fungus, black and humungous.
            In fact, I'm sure I would rather eat fungus.
            I'd rather eat bugs and the shells of three crabs,
            sticky alien brains, all covered in scabs.
            I'd rather eat rocks in a giant brown box.
            I'd rather eat chickens that have chicken pox.

            or the biggest earth worm that you've ever seen.
            I'd rather eat ear wax and slimy eel skin.
            I wisht hat the church would say beets are a sin.
            I'd rather eat garbage, a cockroach or ten,

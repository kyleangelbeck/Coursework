Question 1: Schnorr Protocol
    given:
        5^a=6 mod 64627 | a = 14016
        p = 64627, g = 5, A = 6

    Round 1:
        Peggy chooses r = 10
        Peggy computes t
            t = 5^10 mod 64627 = 6948
        Peggy tells Victor t

        Victor Sends Peggy c = 100
        Peggy computes s
            s = 10 + 14016 * 100 = 1401610
        Peggy tells Victor s

        Victor verifies
            5^1401610 = 6948 * 6^100 mod 64627
            5766 = 5766

    Round 2:
        Peggy chooses r = 20
        Peggy computes t
            t = 5^20 mod 64627 = 62962
        Peggy tells Victor t

        Victor Sends Peggy c = 200
        Peggy computes s
            s = 20 + 14016 * 200 = 2803220
        Peggy tells Victor s

        Victor verifies
            5^2803220 = 62962 * 6^200 mod 64627
            28478 = 28478


    Round 3:
        Peggy chooses r = 30
        Peggy computes t
            t = 5^30 mod 64627 = 64440
        Peggy tells Victor t

        Victor Sends Peggy c = 200
        Peggy computes s
            s = 30 + 14016 * 300 = 4204830
        Peggy tells Victor s

        Victor verifies
            5^4204830 = 64440 * 6^300 mod 64627
            51568 = 51568


Question 2: Zero-Knowledge Proof
    Peggy claims she can instantly count the total number of coins inside a large glass jar. Design a zero-knowledge protocol for
    Peggy to prove this to Victor, without telling him how many coins are in the jar. Once you design your protocol, explain why it is
    Complete, Sound, and Zero-Knowledge.

    Protocol: Peggy turns around, and Victor either adds or removes a specific number of coins. Peggy turns back around,
    and since she knew how many were in the jar before and after she turned around, she can tell him how many were added or removed.

    Completeness: If Peggy is telling the truth then she will answer correctly every time, which is extremely unlikely if she was lying.
        So, if Peggy answers correctly every time, then Victor will be convinced that she is telling the truth.

    Soundness: If Peggy is lying, it is very unlikely that she will be able to randomly guess how many coins were added or removed. If she
        answers incorrectly a single time, then Victor will not be convinced that she is telling the truth.

    Zero-knowledge: Peggy never tells Victor how many coins are in the jar, only how many were added or removed. Victor already knows how many
        he added or removed, so the only knowledge that he gains is that Peggy is telling the truth.


Question 3: Simple Elliptic Curve Arithmetic (Using Sage)
    Let E be the elliptic curve with equation y^2 = x^3+x+6 modulo 11.
    
    How many points are on this curve, including the point at infinity?
        13 points

    Let P=(2,4). What is -P?
        (2,7)

    Let Q=(3,5). What is P+Q?
        (7,2)

    What is 2P?
        (5,9)

    Is there an integer n such that nP=∞? If so, what is it?
        13*P = ∞
        n = 13


Question 4: Elliptic ElGamal (Using Sage)
    Bob has asked Alice a question, and she plans to reply "Yes" using ElGamal with the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3+x+6 modulo 64627.
    However, ("Yes",y) is not on the curve for any value of y. Find a nearby value for x such that (x,y) is on the curve so Alice can respond.

    Yes in base 10: 44596

    Points with x values close to 44596
        (44593,5990), (44593,58637), (44599,9945), (44599,54682)


Question 5: Elliptic Baby-Step Giant-Step (Using Sage)
    E : y^2 = x^3+x+6 modulo 64627
    Find n such that (47884,24106) = n * (52458,4831)

    See attached sage code used to compute n

    n = 99
